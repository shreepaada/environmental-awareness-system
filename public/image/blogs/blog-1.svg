            <h1>Understanding Deforestation</h1>
            <p>
                Deforestation refers to the clearing, or thinning of forests by humans. 
                Deforestation has a wide range of negative effects on the environment 
                including loss of biodiversity, disruption of water cycles, and contribution 
                to climate change. The main causes of deforestation include logging, agriculture, 
                and urban expansion.
            </p>
            <h2>Causes of Deforestation</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Logging:</strong> Commercial logging operations cut down forests for timber.</li>
                <li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Forests are cleared to make way for agricultural land.</li>
                <li><strong>Urban Expansion:</strong> Growing urban areas require space, leading to deforestation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Impact of Deforestation</h2>
            <p>
                The removal of trees without sufficient reforestation has resulted in habitat damage, 
                biodiversity loss, and aridity. It has adverse impacts on biosequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide.
            </p>
            <h2>How to Help</h2>
            <p>
                Supporting reforestation projects, reducing consumption of products that cause deforestation, 
                and spreading awareness are ways to help combat deforestation.
